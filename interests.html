		<p>Machine Learning is an extensively algorithm driven study which makes computer software capable of learning on the basis of their own previous experience and improve the performance of a task. It also gives software ability to analyze, predict and sort huge amounts of data. Some of its applications are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> With the newly added ability to the computers of analyzing data based on some logic, Businesses could predict the upcoming events like growth, market value, employee productivity.</li>
		<li>It also save companies a lot of money due to reduced errors as machines is not prone to make errors that humans make.</li>
		<li>Well, Ml algorithms have been proven to be of use in detecting and diagnosing cancer. An early detection of Melanoma would increase the survival rate.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>

		<h5>Languages: Python, R</h5>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.<br/>

Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core applications of artificial intelligence includes:</p>
		<ul>
		<li> Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of the world, while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few sub-problems such as facial, object and gesture recognition.</li>
		<li>Robotics is also a major field related to AI. Robots require intelligence to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, along with sub-problems of localization, motion planning and mapping.</li>
		<li>Traffic Control, Automating Support, Automating Manufacturing, Fraud Detection, Imposing Laws without corruption etc.</li>
		</ul> <p><br/><br/></p>
