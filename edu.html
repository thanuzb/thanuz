		<h5>Preparation of JEE Main and Advanced(2017-19)</h5>
		<p>A good college for students who want to crack competitive exams.good faculty for first 3 batches ,experienced teachers,good facilities and labs,dedicated staff . If u want to prove that u have stuff Ascent is a gud platform for encouraging students. Main advantage for the college is directors who are very friendly with students and help students to gain conceptual clarity over the subject. On the other side junior lectures 
are the most irritating especially mathematics. Students in this clg are in some prestigious institutions. if one works hard institution doesn't matter. Being a student from ascent i am happy and satisfied with my result .
The teaching staff and books which they give are very good.The only thing that matters is u need to study there perfectly(i mean to say that dont neglect work and study daily).There is no stress in college like narayana and sri chaitanya.They leave the students at 4.30 and if u r intrested then there will be counselling(i.e. Clearing doubts about concepts or sums)

One thing is you'll have full freedom but u need to study . </p><br/> <br/><br/><br/>
