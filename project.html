		</figure>
		<p>Computers play a very significant role in our daily life in fulfilling our requirements. It consists of
various devices, accessories and attachments that help it to perform in an efficient manner. In this
project, we are going to explore about such various devices to gain information about their functions
and roles in the computer, their working principles and algorithms of their working.</p>

<p>This project includes introductory information and includes “basic working principles” of 25
different components of the computer. It also provides information about how these devices integrate
with each other to work efficiently. There has been full attempt to connect these “basic principles”
with the theories of physics that has already been taught to us in higher secondary studies.</p><p><br/><br/></p>

		<p>Rain gardens, also called bioretention facilities, are one of a variety of practices designed to treat polluted stormwater runoff. Rain gardens are a designed depressed area in the landscape that store runoff from impervious urban areas, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas. Rain gardens typically rely on plants and an engineered soil media to soak up stormwater while absorbing and filtering pollutants carried in urban runoff.</p>
		<p>Rain gardens can improve water quality in nearby water bodies and help recharge groundwater. Water filters through layers of soil media before entering the groundwater system or an underdrain. Rain gardens can also reduce the amount of polluted runoff that enters the storm sewer system, which discharges directly to surface waters resulting in erosion, water pollution and flooding.</p>
		<p>Rain garden plantings commonly include wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees. These plants take up nutrients and water that flow into the rain garden, and they release water vapor back to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Microbes help to break down organic compounds (including some pollutants) and remove nitrogen.</p><p><br/><br/></p>
